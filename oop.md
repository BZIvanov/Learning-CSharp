## Inheritance

With *Inheritance* we can easly reuse code, because the derived classes receive all Base class members (fields, properties, methods etc.).

By default if nothing specified the classes we create inherit from **object**, even if we dont see it.

One class can only inherit from another one class, not more than one. But we can implement from many interfaces to achieve some goals.

Example
- **Animal** - Base class, Parent class, Superclass
    - **Cat** - Derived class, Child class, Subclass
    - **Dog** - Derived class, Child class, Subclass
